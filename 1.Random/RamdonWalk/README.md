What is the longest random walk you can take so that on average
you will end up 4 blocks of fewer than from home?

For solving this problem we create a function that move a certain number of blocks and return the position, using Monte Carlos method we itinerate the previous function a huge number of time this for 1 to 30 moves

I encourage to try this script and analyze the results
